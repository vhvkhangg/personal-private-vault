# Implementation Plans

Each phase owns its scope, archived handoff, test evidence, and formal reviews.

## Phases

- [`phase-0/`](phase-0/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN** — bootstrap
- [`phase-1/`](phase-1/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN** — Schema v1 + `reference` + `vault`
- [`phase-2/`](phase-2/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN** — `authentication` + `settings`
- [`phase-3/`](phase-3/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN; MILESTONE_READY** — `people`
- [`phase-4/`](phase-4/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN** — `fiction`
- [`phase-5/`](phase-5/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN** — `film`
- [`phase-6/`](phase-6/README.md) — **COMPLETE / FROZEN; MILESTONE_READY** — `media` + `location`
- [`phase-7/`](phase-7/README.md) — **IMPLEMENTED / READY FOR OWNER COMMIT** — `account`

Maintenance:

- [`maintenance/`](maintenance/README.md) — completed and current owner-approved frozen-phase corrections

See [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md).

## Current state

The active [Phase 7 Account handoff](handoffs/ACTIVE.md) is `READY_FOR_OWNER_COMMIT` after Codex final acceptance re-review.

The Phase 4–6 milestone is `MILESTONE_READY`. The privacy-safe constraint-logging maintenance is complete/frozen,
its handoff is archived, and post-milestone synchronization/reset is complete.

Backend Phase 7 Account preparation was owner committed/pushed. Antigravity corrected all production and test-only
findings; the [final acceptance re-review](phase-7/reviews/2026-09-29-phase-7-final-codex-acceptance-review.md)
is complete. Owner commit/push of the implementation package is pending.
